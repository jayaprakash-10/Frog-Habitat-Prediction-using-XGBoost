# 🐸 Frog Habitat Prediction using XGBoost - Biodiversity Intelligence

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project tackles the **Biodiversity Challenge** by predicting frog presence in Southeast Australia using climate data. Frogs are vital bioindicators of environmental health, and accurate prediction models help conservationists allocate resources effectively. We used **XGBoost**, along with SVM and Random Forest, to forecast frog habitat presence based on climate and location data.
